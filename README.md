# Hi, I'm Eliceo 👋👨‍💻

<img src="EliceoRoAn.png" alt="Banner by Eliceo Romero Antonio |Front-end developer, HTML, Css and js.">

I am passionate about web design and for over 5 years I have dedicated myself to learning about <b>Front-end</b> design on a daily basis, I read books and took many courses that spoke in confusing, strange terms and did not create a real project, my learning path was difficult. But I have managed to master the technologies of <b>HTML, Css and Js</b> that's why I want to share my knowledge to be able to teach other people that web design is amazing and not at all boring or tedious.
