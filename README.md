<p>I am passionate about web design and for over 5 years I have dedicated myself to learning about Front-end design on a daily basis, I read books and took many courses that spoke in confusing, strange terms and did not create a real project, my learning path was difficult. But I have managed to master the technologies of HTML, Css and Js that's why I want to share my knowledge to be able to teach other people that web design is amazing and not at all boring or tedious.</p>
